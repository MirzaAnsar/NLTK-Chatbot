# NLTK ChatBot – Rule-Based Conversational System

## 💬 Project Overview
This project implements a simple rule-based chatbot using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). The chatbot is designed to simulate basic conversation by responding to user greetings, queries, and context-specific prompts through pattern matching and predefined logic.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Regular Expressions (regex)
- Text Preprocessing (tokenization, stemming)

## 🧠 Features
- Greets users and responds to simple questions
- Pattern-matching using regular expressions
- Fallback responses for unknown inputs
- Preprocessing includes tokenization, stemming, and lowercase normalization
- Easily extensible with new intents and responses

## 🧾 What I Did
- Defined chatbot response pairs using regular expressions
- Used NLTK’s `Chat` and `reflections` modules to build conversational flow
- Implemented rule-based patterns for greetings, identity, weather, sports, etc.
- Created a fallback respons
